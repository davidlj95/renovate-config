# Angular versions compatibility sources

This document is to provide traceability of how version compatibility information for each Angular minor version was found.

Generally you can find that information in [Angular version compatibility page]

[Angular version compatibility page]: https://angular.dev/reference/versions

However:

- Sometimes the release is done, but table isn't updated until later
- Not all information isn't there (like `zone.js` compatible versions)

## Index

- [v18.0.x](./v18.0.x.md)
